This project is an educational and game platform demo application that can help preschool children in their
physical and mental education. After installing the relevant libraries in the codes, you can start 
the application by running the anasafya.ipynb file.

Note:
I would like to thank my teammates Muhammed Tayyip Köse, Esma Nur Çifci and Merve Akyıldız
who worked with me on the project.
